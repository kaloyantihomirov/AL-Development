# AL Development

Welcome to my AL Development repository! This space is dedicated to my journey as a junior AL developer. Here, you'll find a collection of various extensions and modules I've developed while exploring Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Each project showcases my growth, learning, and custom implementations based on real-world scenarios and guided by expert resources.

This repository documents my progress and experiments as I learn and grow in the field of AL development. Through each extension and module, I aim to solve real-world problems, implement best practices, and share my findings with the community.

**Description:** This extension addresses various business requirements for the sales and vendor quality management departments.

**Main Features:**

- **Item Ledger Entries:** Stores customer category values in item ledger entries for future reporting.
- **Item Charges Calculation:** Calculates and assigns item charges to sales orders based on defined criteria.
